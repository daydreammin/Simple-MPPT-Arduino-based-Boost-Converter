# Simple-MPPT-Arduino-based-Boost-Converter

A MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) boost converter is a DC-DC converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher level. To achieve the best results we use MPPT algorithms to set the PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) value, which controls the speed at which the switch (mosfet) opens and closes. In this case the MPPT algorithm I use is incremental conductance.
