# Simple-MPPT-Arduino-based-Boost-Converter

## Circuit design and arduino code to implement a Boost Converter.

A MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracker) boost converter is a DC-DC converter that steps up the input voltage to a higher level. To achieve the best results we use MPPT algorithms to control the PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) which controls the speed at which the switch (mosfet) opens and closes. In this case the MPPT algorithm I use is incremental conductance.
